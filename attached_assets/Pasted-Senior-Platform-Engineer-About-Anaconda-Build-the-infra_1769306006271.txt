About the role

As a Senior Platform Engineer on our Platform Core team, you'll own critical infrastructure components that keep our SaaS and self-hosted enterprise products fast, reliable, and scalable. You'll design solutions that reduce operational toil, collaborate across engineering teams to solve complex challenges, and help your peers deliver better software faster. Your work directly enables product teams to build with confidence and customers to innovate without friction.


We build together—sharing solutions transparently and collaborating across teams. We own it by delivering reliable, well-tested systems and taking responsibility for their performance. We're curious by default, investigating root causes and learning from incidents. And we lead with guts and heart, combining technical conviction with care for the developer experience we create.


What you'll do

    Design, build, and improve infrastructure components supporting both our SaaS and self-hosted enterprise products, focusing on stability, efficiency, and a strong experience for our internal and external users
    Own services and subsystems end-to-end, taking responsibility for their reliability, performance, and operational excellence through design, implementation, and monitoring
    Collaborate with other Engineering and Product teams to troubleshoot cross-layer issues and ensure platform readiness for new features and AI workloads
    Empower developers by automating workflows, providing robust tooling, and creating best practice documentation that enables self-service and autonomous delivery
    Monitor and support production systems by participating in on-call rotations, responding to incidents, and conducting proactive system health reviews
    Contribute to both planned infrastructure initiatives and ad-hoc requests, maintaining flexibility while driving continuous platform improvements
    Engage in team communication channels (Slack, meetings, code reviews, demos) to share knowledge, provide feedback, and coordinate efforts


Your impact will be measured through

    Reliability and uptime of platform components you own, and reductions in incident severity or response time
    Improvements in developer velocity through automation, tooling, and documentation that reduce manual toil
    Measurable gains in infrastructure stability, performance, or scalability that support growing workloads and new use cases
    Knowledge sharing and mentorship that elevates the capability of your peers and the team


What you need

    Strong experience working with Kubernetes, Helm, and related open source tooling
    Advanced experience working in cloud environments (AWS, Azure, etc.) or on-premise servers
    High familiarity with core infrastructure concepts: storage, CI/CD, networking, observability, security, and Linux systems
    Proficiency coding using IaC (e.g. Terraform, CDK, etc.) and imperative languages (Python, Go)
    Experience with production systems: on-call participation, incident response, and root-cause analysis
    Demonstrated ability to own a service or infrastructure component end-to-end and drive meaningful improvements in reliability, performance, or developer experience
    A self-starter mentality comfortable in dynamic environments with a strong instinct to reduce toil and automate workflows
    Strong written and verbal communication skills; ability to document technical decisions and explain complex concepts through ADRs, SDDs, and architecture diagrams.
    Ability to foster an environment where all people can be curious by default, build collaboratively, practice absolute accountability, and innovate relentlessly


What will make you stand out

    Anaconda, Python, or OSS community experience
    Familiarity managing multi-cloud or hybrid architectures
    Understanding of AI / ML / GPU development patterns and infrastructure requirements
    Knowledge around cloud marketplaces and cost optimization strategies
    Familiarity working in and testing code in Windows and Mac environments
    Experience working remotely and across transcontinental timezones
    Great peer recommendations and appreciation from colleagues


Why you'll like working here

    You'll thrive in a high-performance environment where results are recognized and rewarded
    Your work directly contributes to shaping the future of data science, machine learning, and AI in the enterprise.
    You'll work alongside a collaborative team that values diverse, thoughtful discussion, clarity and candor.
