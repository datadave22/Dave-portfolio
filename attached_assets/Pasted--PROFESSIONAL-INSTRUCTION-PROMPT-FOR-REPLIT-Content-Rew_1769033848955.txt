🚀 PROFESSIONAL INSTRUCTION PROMPT FOR REPLIT
(Content Rewrite + Intro Animation Update)

📌 OVERALL GOAL
Rewrite and restructure the current site (https://elite-designer--dave78234578.replit.app/) into a polished, professional technology and cybersecurity portfolio. The site should clearly communicate value, measurable impact, and real-world expertise using modern professional language suitable for hiring managers and technical leadership.

In addition, redesign the intro animation to serve as a generative, mathematically inspired visual experience that reinforces technical sophistication, systems thinking, and intentional design.

────────────────────────────────────────
0. INTRO ANIMATION / HERO THEME (NEW)
────────────────────────────────────────

HIGH-LEVEL CONCEPT:
Replace the current intro animation with a calm, immersive, generative visualization inspired by a black hole / event horizon.

The animation should:
- Feel mathematical, intentional, and infinite
- Use hundreds to thousands of shapes or particles
- Appear as if shapes/light are being slowly pulled into a central singularity
- Be meditative and watchable, encouraging the user to pause before scrolling

VISUAL REQUIREMENTS:
- Central event-horizon / black-hole focal point
- Shapes (circles, lines, polygons, particles, or abstract geometry) originate from the outer edges and are pulled inward
- Subtle golden-ratio–inspired gradient color transitions (gold, amber, muted blues/purples)
- Smooth, slow motion (no jitter or chaos)
- Illusion of depth (z-axis scaling, opacity, or blur)

MATHEMATICAL / GENERATIVE BEHAVIOR:
Use parametric motion inspired by:

x = r1 * cos(theta1 + rho1)
y = r2 * sin(theta2 + rho2)
z = r3 * cos(theta3 + rho3)

Implementation guidance:
- Randomize r, theta, and rho per particle
- Each site visit should generate a unique parameter seed
- Motion should evolve continuously to create a non-repeating, infinite flow
- Z-depth should influence scale, opacity, or motion speed

USER INTERACTION:
- Animation is visible immediately on page load
- Users can sit and watch indefinitely
- Scrolling reveals site content
- Scrolling back to the top resumes the animation (do not reset unless page reloads)
- Optimize performance (requestAnimationFrame; Canvas/WebGL preferred)

TECHNICAL SUGGESTIONS (NOT MANDATORY):
- HTML Canvas, Three.js, or lightweight WebGL
- Deterministic random seed per session
- Responsive and mobile-safe (reduce particle count on small devices)

────────────────────────────────────────
1. HOMEPAGE / HERO CONTENT
────────────────────────────────────────

Overlay minimal, readable text on top of the animation.

Replace existing content with:

────────────────────────────────────────
6. PROFESSIONAL NARRATIVE FLOW
────────────────────────────────────────

1. Immersive Intro Animation
2. Hero Value Statement
3. Professional Summary
4. Core Competencies
5. Featured Projects
6. Cybersecurity Experience
7. Contact / Connect

────────────────────────────────────────
7. LANGUAGE & TONE GUIDELINES
────────────────────────────────────────

- Use active voice (“Designed”, “Developed”, “Delivered”)

- Maintain confident, modern professional tone
- No filler text or incoherent copy

────────────────────────────────────────
8. END GOAL
────────────────────────────────────────

Update the existing website so it reflects a polished, modern technology professional brand. The intro animation should demonstrate technical depth and systems thinking, while the written content communicates business value, real-world impact, and professional credibility. All sections should flow logically and support hiring or client conversion.
