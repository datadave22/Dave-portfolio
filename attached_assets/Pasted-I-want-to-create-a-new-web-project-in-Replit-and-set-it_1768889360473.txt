I want to create a new web project in Replit and set it up for professional development with GitHub integration, branching, and deployment readiness. Follow these instructions carefully.

### Project Goals
1. Full-page landing animation (like the black hole effect from https://www.cosmos.so/) with shapes being sucked into the center.
2. Article/knowledge base site where I can add content as HTML/Markdown files.
3. Smooth fade-in/fade-out transitions from landing animation to main content.
4. Fully responsive, professional design, ready to publish.

### Git / GitHub Setup
1. Initialize Git in the Replit project.
2. Connect the project to a **new GitHub repository**.
3. Create the following branches:
   - `main` or `production` → for the live, published version
   - `develop` → for active development
   - `test` → for testing new features/animations
   - Any other useful branches you recommend for a clean workflow (e.g., `feature/*` branches)
4. Set `main` (production) as the default branch.
5. Make sure commits, pushes, and pulls are properly configured for GitHub.
6. Include instructions in the code/comments on how to:
   - Switch branches
   - Merge changes
   - Push/pull to GitHub
   - Publish to Replit without breaking the production branch

### Project Structure
- `index.html` → landing page with black hole animation
- `articles/` → folder for article HTML or Markdown files
- `css/` → stylesheets
- `js/` → scripts for animations, interactivity
- `assets/` → images, icons, etc.
- `.gitignore` → ignore node_modules, temp files, or any other unnecessary files
- `README.md` → instructions and project overview

### Coding Requirements
1. Black hole animation using HTML/CSS/JS (Canvas or Three.js) with smooth motion and gravitational effect for shapes.
2. Article pages should be easy to add/update.
3. Navigation between landing page and articles.
4. Responsive design for desktop + mobile.
5. Publish-ready: works with Replit’s Publish feature.

### Deliverables
1. Fully functional Replit project with Git/GitHub integration.
2. All branches (`main`, `develop`, `test`) created and ready.
3. Clear comments explaining folder structure, branching workflow, and publishing.
4. Instructions on adding new articles or animations.
5. Setup should allow future AI assistants (ChatGPT, Claude) or developers to make changes via GitHub or Replit.

Important:
- Do NOT make assumptions about content for articles; leave placeholders.
- Focus on architecture, Git workflow, and professional coding practices.
- Ensure this is ready for collaborative development and production deployment.
